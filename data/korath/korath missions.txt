			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk.

After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

			`There are no crowds waiting for you when you land. Rather the ground crews seem astonished to see the ship. It takes you some time to arrange for repairs but at least they are familiar with the ship. When you come out you see a pavilion has been set up near the <EDC-ship> and small groups of Korath periodically stop by.`

			`	The tent is larger than you expected. At the back there is a group of Korath arragned like a choir, but standing oddly still. A Korath in some kind of robes stands next to a table piled with sweets can cups of some kind of thick drink. As you approach, you realize that the "choir" is made of holograms. You do a quick mental count and guess that these are the Korath that died on the ship; this is probably some type of memorial. The Korath in robes greets you and presses a cup into your hand. It is fermented and has a sweet and sour taste that leaves you lips and mouth tingling and then numb. They press the sweets on you so you take them. You see a few groups from the spaceport follow the same ritual, though some of them walk up to the "choir" and say something to them. When you finish the food, you take your leave and return to your ship.`

			`	You approach one of the Quarg in the spaceport. It stops and acknowledges you but doesn't speak. It pauses for a few moments after you make your request but then holds out its hand. It takes the data chip and slots it into a communicator of some sort, It then nods to itself and hands you back the chip.`
			`	You plug the chip into your own device and see two files. On opening the second one your read, "Belonging this ship, <EDC-ship>, to alien Human <first> <last>. Grateful from those they helped. Stranded ones thank. Grieving ones thank."`
			`	You store the chip carefully and return to your ship.`
