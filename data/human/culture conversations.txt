			`As you wander the spaceport with a snack, waiting for your ship to be refueled, you pass a local souvenir shop and poke your head in to kill a little time. You see a decent looking mug with the text "<source>" printed underneath an attractive, stylized representation of the spaceport you are presently standing in and pick it up to see how it feels. The handle is solid, not too small for your fingers, and the lip of it looks like it would be comfortable to drink out of.`
			`	Two young adults wander into the aisle just a couple of meters away. They're clearly from abroad judging by their conversation occurring in some local dialect which is neither local nor one you understand. They're cooing over an item they've found, but when one flips it over to look at the price tag, there is an immediate exchange of looks and expressions that does not require translation. The item ends up back on the shelf with a giggle and a head-shake.`
			`	Curious, you turn over your own mug and see that it is indeed at least five times what you would expect to pay for a mug, even a good one. Still, it is certainly a novelty...`

					goto buy

# If anyone wants to add receipt of an actual mug outfit feel free:
# Amazinite: Let's give the player a mug outfit and take 50 credits from them by making this an invisible mission where on accept you get the outfit and lose the credits, then automatically fail the mission.

They sadly inform you that there's been a bumper banana crop, but unfortunately other wealthier worlds had a bumper crop at the same time, and there's nowhere to either sell or store a significant excess. Distressed farmers are burning the excess fruit to make fertilizer for the next season, the wind has carried the smell all over town.`

			`Visiting the Paradise spaceports is always an interesting experience for someone from abroad. Nowhere else is class such an ingrained component of daily life. You find yourself noticing people who seem to be invisible to most of those going about their business, but they never catch your eye. They always appear to be doing their utmost to avoid notice.`
			`	You haven't noticed children that look poor here in the past, but on this occasion you spot one as he knocks over a mop and bucket... right in front of a businessman and his family rolling their bags through the spaceport. You've never seen someone go so deathly pale as the cleaner, the boy's mother, who scurries to fix things before the man even draws a breath.`
			`	A pair of security officers appear almost immediately, before you could intercede one way or the other, as the man and his family begin to complain. One officer provides assurances as the other supervises the cleaner, who quickly hurries her child out of harms way.`

			`As you walk past a number of ships and crew going about their work in the spaceport, a small gathering in front of a Shuttle catches your attention. A young woman wearing a rather cheesy pilot uniform is in the midst of a little group of people all celebrating together. As you pass by them, a man standing on the top of a ladder breaks a bottle of Champagne on the (clearly not new) ship's hull. A loud cheer erupts from the group, earning an embarrassed blush from the young woman.`
			choice
				`	(Take a closer look.)`
					goto investigate
				`	(Shout well wishes as I pass by)`
					goto passby
				`	(Ignore them, I have more important things to do.)`

				decline
			label passby
			`	You hurry past the group as they quiet down. Taking advantage of the momentary lull, you shout "Good luck! You've got this!" toward them. They let out another cheer in response, with the exception of the young woman who buries her face in her hands.`
				decline
			label investigate
			`	You approach the group as they quiet down, noticing a hint of anxiety in the air.`
			`	"Nothing quite like buying your very first starship," you say over their chatter. The celebration goes quiet as they turn to see who interrupted their little party.`
			`	"It's certainly been an... experience," the young woman replies once you are in comfortable talking distance.`
			choice
				`	"Have you got any big plans with it?"`
					goto plans
				`	(Give some advice.)`
					goto advice
				`	"So, who's the lucky pilot?"`
			`	You gesture to the Shuttle and look around as if it should be anyone else.`
			`	"Uhh... that would be me," the woman says, glancing around awkwardly.`
			choice
				`	(Try to salvage the awkward situation.)`
				`	(Get out while you can.)`
					goto getout
			`	"I'm just messing with you, my psychiatrist doesn't think it's very funny when I do it to him either."`
			`	"Oh," the woman says quietly, "that's... nice, I guess."`
			label getout
			`	You realize that you have made this random young lady quite uncomfortable by barging in with your input.`
			`	"Well, good luck!" you say with a wave as you hurry away. You barely hear the quiet "thank you" over the burning in your ears.`
				decline
			label plans
			`	"Right now," she says with a sigh, "the only plan I have is to get rid of the massive debt that I'm in because of it."`
			label advice
			`	"The mortgage isn't so bad as long as you're willing to work hard," you say with a smile, "and there is no shortage of people in need of a ship and a good pilot."`
			`	"I knew you could make a decent living with one, but is it really that easy?" she asks.`
			`	"The work isn't easy, but finding a job is the least of your worries. I'm sure that you'll have this ship paid off in no time."`
			`	You stay around and talk with the aspiring pilot for a few minutes, giving her tips and advice before stating that you have work to do. As you turn to leave, an older man places his hand on your arm, stopping you.`
			`	"Before you go," the man says, "we weren't very sure about this whole 'pilot' thing at first, but it's good to hear that my little girl has made the right decision. Thank you for that."`
			`	"It's the least I could do," you say before walking away.`
